# Listening Party

A simple node.js-based app for controlling Quicktime Player on Yosemite via the browser

### Requirements
* OSX Yosemite (because we use Javascript for system scripting)
* Quicktime Player
* Node.js and npm (installed via homebrew works just fine)


### Instructions

1. Make sure node and npm are installed
2. In the project folder, run `npm install`
3. After the libraries are installed, change into the src folder: `cd src`
4. Make sure the media file you want to play/pause is open in Quicktime Player
5. Run the app: `node index.js`
